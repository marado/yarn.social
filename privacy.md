information, what happens when your account is deleted and some other
frequently asked questions answered regarding your privacy.

If you have any more questions, please raise an issue regarding
the same on our [Issue Tracker](https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/yarn/issues/new)

  <summary>How is this all free? There must be a catch!</summary>
  <p>
    Absolutely no catch to this freebie. This project is just my way of
    giving back to the community that I've learned so much from. If you'd
    like to show your appreciation however, you can follow me on my social
    media and let me know how much it helped you, or donate to help pay
    the cloud bills, or if you are a fellow developer, you can head to
    git.mills.io and contribute to the code by raising a PR.
