[Yarn.social](https://yarn.social) is a decentralized self-hosted social media
that has a privacy-first focus.

There are no ads, no tracking and no personal information is ever collected or stored.

## Getting Started

### Join an existing Pod

You are welcome to join one of the existing pods listed here:

- [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net)
  The first Yarn.social pod launched on the 20th July 2020 and hosted in
  Australia/Brisbane by [James Mills](https://prologic.shortcircuit.net.au)
  at the Mills DC (_a mini data center focused on self-hosted infra_).
- [twt.nfld.uk](https://twt.nfld.uk)
  A yarn.social pod hosted in the UK by [@jlj](https://twt.nfld.uk/user/jlj/)

### Run a Pod

If you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com) installed and available to run
containers you can run a `yarnd` instance by simply running:

```#!sh
$ docker run -p 8000:8000 prologic/yarnd
```

Otherwise it is recommended to clone the source code and build `yarnd`
from source. Be sure to have [Go](https://golang.org) installed.

```#!sh
$ git clone https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/yarn
$ cd yarn
$ make deps
$ make
```

Now run your instance by running:

```#!sh
yarnd
```

For options see `yarnd --help`.

### Manually

Since Yarn.social is built upon the [Twtxt](https://twtxt.readthedocs.org) spec
with a few [small extensions](https://dev.twtxt.net), all you need to do to
join the network and participate in the growing number of users and
conversations is have:

- A `twtxt.txt` file hosted somewhere
- A `avatar.png` hosted next to your `twtxt.txt`
- A [twtxt](https://twtxt.readthedocs.org) client such as:
    - [jenny](https://uninformativ.de/git/jenny): A console twtxt client
      with [mutt](http://www.mutt.org) integration
      ([tutorial](https://www.uninformativ.de/blog/postings/2021-09-19/0/POSTING-en.html))

## Services

The following supporting services help to support the Yarn.social platform and
are provided for the benefit of all users:

- [search.twtxt.net](https://search.twtxt.net)
  This is an instance of the [Yarns](//git.mills.io/yarnsocial/yarn)
  search engine and crawls and indexes Yarn.social pods and Twtxt feeds.
- [feeds.twtxt.net](https://feeds.twtxt.net)
  This is an instance of [rss2twtxt](//git.mills.io/yarnsocial/rss2twtxt)
  and is used as the primary "feed source" for all Yarn.social pods (by default)
  and supports RSS/Atom and Twitter‚Ñ¢. This allows users to "subscribe" to and
  "follow" websites, blogs or Twitter‚Ñ¢ accounts.

## Sources

The project is managed by a self-hosted [Gitea](https://gitea.io) instance by
over at https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial

- [yarn](https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/yarn)
  üìï The `yarnd` self-hosted Yarn.social Pod server itself
  as well as the `yarnc` command-line client for posting
  and interacting with your pod's API.
- [yarns](https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/yarns)
  üîç The Yarn.social search engine that crawls the network of
  pods and twtxt feeds, scrapes and indexed every post (yarns).
- [rss2twtxt](https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/rss2twtxt)
  üìú an RSS/Atom and Twitter feed aggregator that consumes RSS/Atom and Twitter‚Ñ¢
  feeds and produces twtxt feeds for consumption by Yarn.social pods as well as
  twtxt clients in general.
- [Goryon](https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/goryon)
  üê¶ A Flutter iOS and Android App for the Yarn.social backend API
  (`yarnd`)` to provide a native mobile experience for users. Goryon connects
  to any valid Yarn.social pod such a [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net).
