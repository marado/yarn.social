<img align="left" width="100" height="100" src="/logo.png" style="padding-right: 5pt" />

[Yarn.social](https://yarn.social) is a decentralised self-hosted social media
that has a privacy-first focus.

There are no ads, no tracking and no personal information is ever collected or stored.

## Getting Started

### Run a Pod

If you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com) installed and available to run
containers you can run a `yarnd` instance by simply running:

```#!sh
$ docker run -p 8000:8000 prologic/yarnd
```

Otherwise it is recommended to clone the source code and build `yarnd`
from source. Be sure to have [Go](https://golang.org) installed.

```#!sh
$ https://git.mills.io/yarnsocial/yarn
$ cd yarn
$ go build ./cmd/yarnd/...
$ go install  ./cmd/yarnd/...
```

Now run your instance by running:

```#!sh
yarnd
```

For options see `yarnd --help`.

### Manually

Since Yarn.social is built upon the [Twtxt](https://twtxt.readthedocs.org) with
a few [small extensions](https://dev.twtxt.net) all you need to join the network
and participate in the growing numbers of users and conversations is:

- A `twtxt.txt` file hosted somewhere
- A `avatar.png` hosted next to your `twtxt.txt`
- A [twtxt](https://twtxt.readthedocs.org) client

### Hosting
